Summer precipitation;Drought;1;The map and graph display, depending on the chosen scenario, the average amount of precipitation in the months of June, July, and August in the current climate (1991-2020) and for the climate around 2050 and 2100. The lowest scenario is referred to as Ln, and the highest as Hd. Nationally, summer precipitation decreases in all climate scenarios, with the greatest reduction in the Hd scenario (-29% by 2100). The decrease in summer precipitation is due to winds more frequently bringing dry, continental air from the east.;60,100,140,180,220,260,300;mm;#06C603,#5CE09A,#97FCFF,#87BAD5,#3D50FF,#802BC0,#D620F4
Series of dry days;Drought;2;The map and graph display, depending on the chosen scenario, the maximum number of consecutive dry days (< 0.3 mm precipitation) per year in the current climate (1991-2020) and for the climate around 2050 and 2100. The lowest scenario is referred to as Ln, and the highest as Hd. A longer period of dry days increases the water deficit. In sunny weather, high temperatures, and wind, significant evaporation occurs, rapidly increasing the water deficit.;14,15,16,17,18,19,20;Number of days;#F5F908, #F5AC05, #F55E05, #FA2804, #F00004, #780103, #000000
Maximum precipitation deficit;Drought;3;The map and graph display, depending on the chosen scenario, the maximum potential precipitation deficit between April 1 and September 30 in the current climate (1991-2020) and for the climate around 2050 and 2100. The lowest scenario is referred to as Ln, and the highest as Hd. The precipitation deficit is used as a measure of drought. The deficit increases when potential evaporation exceeds precipitation and decreases when precipitation exceeds potential evaporation. The precipitation deficit cannot be lower than 0. The maximum precipitation deficit is defined as the highest value of the deficit in a year. It is expected that the precipitation deficit in the Netherlands will significantly increase, especially in the south. According to the warm, dry scenario (Hd), an average summer around 2100 will be as dry as an extremely dry summer in the current climate (1991-2020).;100,150,200,250,300,350,400;mm;#F5F908, #F5AC05, #F55E05, #FA2804, #F00004, #780103, #000029
Annual reference evaporation;Drought;5;The map and graph display, depending on the chosen scenario, the annual reference evaporation (according to Makkink) in the current climate (1991-2020) and for the climate around 2050 and 2100. For 2050, the lowest scenario is Hn, and the highest is Hd, and for 2100, the lowest scenario is Ln, and the highest is Hd.
