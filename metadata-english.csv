Water depth during heavy rainfall;perc5_10mm,perc10_15mm,perc15_20mm,perc20_30mm,perc30mmME,percNODATA;Water depth during a heavy rainfall of 70 mm / 2 hours;Multiline;;Effects;These statistics show the water depth that occurs during a heavy summer rainstorm. The graphs display the percentage of an area per water depth class. Buildings, surface water, and areas with less than 5 mm are not shown with colored bars. The statistics are based on an equal sewer storage and discharge capacity and on the height map of 2012. This means that this information is not useful for areas developed or modified after 2012.
